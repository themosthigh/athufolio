> My Cyber Shujaa Journey So Far: Conquering Network Security and Risk Management, Gearing Up for SIEM!

Hey everyone! I'm currently on an incredible learning journey with **Cyber Shujaa**, a fantastic program here in Kenya that's equipping me with the skills to tackle the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity. It's been an intensive but incredibly rewarding experience, and I wanted to share a bit about my progress and what I've been learning.

Looking at my coursework checklist, it's so satisfying to see those green checkmarks!

- ✅ Network Security
- ✅ Risk Management
- [ ] SIEM & SOC Tools

### Diving Deep: What I've Conquered So Far

#### **Module 1: Network Security – Building the Foundation**

This was one of the first major modules I tackled, and it really cemented my understanding of how everything connects (literally!). Before this, I understood networking at a very basic level, but the Cyber Shujaa course took me much deeper.

I learned about:

- **Network Topologies & Devices:** Understanding the different ways networks are structured and the roles of devices like routers, switches, and firewalls. It made abstract diagrams suddenly make sense!
- **Protocols (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, etc.):** This was a big one. Demystifying how data actually travels across the internet and what each protocol does was fascinating. Suddenly, Browse the web or sending an email felt like a more intricate dance.
- **Common Network Attacks:** Learning about things like sniffing, spoofing, denial-of-service, and how they work. This was where theory started meeting practice, as we looked at ways to detect and prevent these.
- **Firewalls & IDS/IPS:** Understanding how these crucial security mechanisms protect networks. Configuring basic firewall rules and grasping the difference between an Intrusion Detection System and an Intrusion Prevention System was super valuable.

The biggest takeaway for me from Network Security was realizing that you can't secure what you don't understand. Having a strong grasp of networking fundamentals is absolutely essential for any cybersecurity professional.

#### **Module 2: Risk Management – Thinking Like a Security Strategist**

Honestly, when I first saw "Risk Management" on the syllabus, I thought it might be a bit dry. But I was so wrong! This module completely shifted my perspective from just "fixing things" to "thinking strategically about security."

We covered:

- **Identifying Assets & Threats:** Learning to pinpoint what needs protecting (information, systems, reputation) and what kind of dangers they face (malware, human error, natural disasters). This felt like a crucial first step in any security assessment.
- **Assessing Vulnerabilities:** Understanding how to identify weaknesses that could be exploited. This tied back nicely to what I learned in network security!
- **Calculating Risk (Qualitative & Quantitative):** This was a challenge, but incredibly insightful. Learning how to weigh the likelihood of an event against its potential impact was a new way of thinking for me.
- **Implementing Controls & Mitigation:** Discovering various strategies to reduce risk, from technical controls (like encryption) to administrative controls (like policies and training).
- **The Risk Management Lifecycle:** Understanding that risk management isn't a one-time thing, but an ongoing process of assessment, treatment, monitoring, and review.

This module taught me that cybersecurity isn't just about technical prowess; it's also about understanding the business context and making informed decisions to protect an organization effectively. It really made me feel like I was moving beyond just technical skills to becoming a well-rounded security professional.

### What's Next: Eagerly Awaiting SIEM & SOC Tools!

Now, the next big one on my list is **SIEM & SOC Tools**! I'm genuinely buzzing with anticipation for this module. From what I've heard and read, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems are the nerve center of any modern Security Operations Center (SOC).

I'm really looking forward to:

- **Hands-on with SIEM Platforms:** I'm hoping to get practical experience with popular SIEM solutions like Splunk, ELK Stack, or others. Understanding how to aggregate, analyze, and correlate logs from various sources sounds incredibly powerful.
- **Understanding Alerting & Incident Response:** Learning how SOC analysts use SIEMs to detect suspicious activities and kick off incident response procedures. This feels like the "active defense" part of cybersecurity.
- **Automation & Playbooks:** If we touch on it, I'd love to see how some of the routine tasks in a SOC can be automated to improve efficiency.

The thought of working in a SOC, actively defending against cyber threats, is something that truly excites me, and I know this module will be key to understanding that role.

### Looking Forward!

My Cyber Shujaa journey has been amazing so far, pushing me to learn and grow in ways I hadn't expected. Every completed module feels like a new superpower gained, and I'm incredibly grateful for the practical, hands-on approach.

If you're considering a career in cybersecurity or just looking to upskill, programs like Cyber Shujaa are invaluable. Wish me luck as I dive into SIEM & SOC Tools – I'm ready for the next challenge!
