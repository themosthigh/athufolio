> My First Steps in Cybersecurity: Conquering TryHackMe's Introduction to Cybersecurity

Hey everyone! If you're anything like me, you've probably been curious about cybersecurity but weren't sure where to start. Well, I finally took the plunge, and my first stop was **TryHackMe's 'Introduction to Cybersecurity' module**. And let me tell you, it's been an absolute game-changer!

The little green checkmark next to the module name on TryHackMe is such a satisfying feeling, marking off this foundational step. Before this, terms like "Linux navigation" and "file permissions" sounded a bit intimidating, but now, I feel like I've got a solid grasp of them.

### Why I Chose TryHackMe (and This Module)

I'd heard a lot about TryHackMe's hands-on approach, and it truly lives up to the hype. As a learner, I find that actually _doing_ things helps me understand concepts far better than just reading about them. This "Introduction to Cybersecurity" module felt like the perfect starting point because it promised to cover the absolute basics, which is exactly what I needed.

### What I Learned (and Why It's So Important!)

This module wasn't just about memorizing commands; it was about understanding the logic behind them. Here are the two big areas I tackled:

#### **1. Linux Navigation: My New Best Friend (Mostly!)**

Before this, my experience with command-line interfaces was pretty limited to some basic Windows commands. Linux, with its different directory structures and commands, felt like learning a new language. But the module broke it down beautifully.

I got comfortable with:

- `ls`: Listing files and directories – my go-to command for seeing what's around.
- `cd`: Changing directories – crucial for moving around the file system.
- `pwd`: Knowing where I am – super important so I don't get lost!
- `cat` and `less`: Viewing file contents – essential for reading configuration files or looking for clues.
- `mkdir` and `rm`: Creating and deleting directories and files – gotta learn how to clean up after yourself!

It felt a bit clunky at first, but after a few exercises, navigating around a Linux system started to feel much more intuitive. This skill is clearly foundational for almost any cybersecurity role, whether you're analyzing logs, running tools, or interacting with servers.

#### **2. File Permissions: Unlocking the Gates**

This was probably the most eye-opening part for me. I always knew files had "permissions," but I didn't truly grasp the `rwx` (read, write, execute) concept or how they applied to users, groups, and others.

The module really drilled home:

- **Understanding `rwx`:** What each letter means for files and directories.
- **Users, Groups, Others:** Who has what level of access. This explained so much about why certain actions are restricted.
- **`chmod` and `chown`:** How to change permissions and ownership. While I might not be changing critical system files right now, understanding _how_ these work is vital for later understanding misconfigurations or exploits.

This concept of file permissions immediately clicked as something critically important for security. A file with overly permissive settings can be a huge vulnerability, and now I understand why!

### My Takeaways and What's Next

Completing this 'Introduction to Cybersecurity' module has given me a huge boost in confidence. It showed me that complex topics can be broken down into manageable parts and that hands-on practice is irreplaceable.

If you're just starting out, I can't recommend TryHackMe enough. This module is an excellent first step, building a solid foundation in Linux that you'll undoubtedly use in every subsequent cybersecurity learning path.

I'm excited to keep exploring more modules and challenges on TryHackMe. The journey has just begun, and I'm ready for the next level!
